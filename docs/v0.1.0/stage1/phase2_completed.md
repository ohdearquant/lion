Below is an **exhaustively detailed** instruction set for **Phase 2** of the
lion project. Building on Phase 1’s foundation (workspace setup, core
primitives, and basic CLI), Phase 2 introduces the **microkernel orchestrator**
and **system-level events** for handling tasks in an event-driven manner. All
references to coding style, concurrency, and security come from the overarching
**lion Developer Guide**.

---

# Phase 2 – Microkernel Orchestrator & System Events

## 1. High-Level Objectives

1. **Introduce an Orchestrator**:
   - Implement either an actor-based or a custom event-loop approach for
     handling system events (e.g., `TaskSubmitted`, `TaskCompleted`).
   - This orchestrator or “microkernel” acts as the central dispatcher.

2. **Define & Test Basic System Events**:
   - Create a `SystemEvent` enum describing events like “task submitted,” “task
     completed,” “error occurred,” etc.

3. **Add a Simple Event Flow**:
   - Submitting a “task” leads the orchestrator to produce a “completed” event,
     simulating minimal “work.”

4. **Extend the CLI**:
   - Possibly add a new command `submit-task --data <string>` that sends a
     “TaskSubmitted” event to the orchestrator.
   - Optionally, a `run-orchestrator` command that blocks and processes events
     (if using a separate process approach).

5. **Validation**:
   - Unit tests to confirm the orchestrator logic works (actor messages or
     channel-based event loop).
   - CLI/integration tests showing a user can submit tasks and see them
     completed.

**Expected Outcome**\
By the end of Phase 2, the codebase will have a **functioning orchestrator**
that receives system events, simulates minimal concurrency or scheduling logic,
and logs or outputs “TaskCompleted” events. We tag the final commit as
`v0.0.1a-phase2`.

---

## 2. Technical Requirements & Outcomes

1. **Orchestrator Module**
   - A new file `orchestrator.rs` in `agentic_core/src/` implementing either:
     - An **actor model** (using [Actix](https://actix.rs/) or ractor)
     - A **custom Tokio-based** event loop with a `mpsc::Sender<SystemEvent>`
       and `mpsc::Receiver<SystemEvent>`

2. **SystemEvent Enum**
   - Located in `orchestrator.rs` or a separate file like `events.rs`.
   - Variants to model minimal workflows, e.g.:
     ```rust
     pub enum SystemEvent {
         TaskSubmitted { task_id: Uuid, payload: String },
         TaskCompleted { task_id: Uuid, result: String },
         // ...
     }
     ```

3. **Event Flow**
   - On receiving `TaskSubmitted`, the orchestrator simulates “work” (like a
     short async delay or immediate “TaskCompleted”).
   - This confirms the “submit → handle → complete” flow.

4. **CLI Enhancements**
   - `submit-task --data "..."` to send the orchestrator a “TaskSubmitted”
     event.
   - Possibly `run-orchestrator` if you want an interactive orchestrator session
     (optional at Phase 2).
   - Or a single “agentic-cli submit-task --data ...” command that internally
     calls orchestrator code (if no separate process is needed).

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for orchestrator logic (mock or actual event channels).
   - Integration tests for the CLI to ensure “task submitted → eventually
     completed.”

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation

This phase can be split into four major tasks: **(A) Setting up the Orchestrator
Approach**, **(B) Defining System Events**, **(C) Integrating the CLI**, and
**(D) Validation & Tests**.

### 3.A. **Setting Up the Orchestrator Approach**

1. **Decide on Actor vs. Custom Event Loop**
   - **Actor-based** (e.g., using [Actix](https://actix.rs/)):
     - You’ll create an `Orchestrator` struct that implements `Actor` and handle
       messages that correspond to your `SystemEvent`.
     - Great for easily spawning multiple “agent” actors in later phases.
   - **Custom** (using raw Tokio `mpsc::channel`):
     - A `struct Orchestrator` with `event_rx: mpsc::Receiver<SystemEvent>`,
       plus a `run()` method processing events in a loop with `select!`.

2. **Add Dependencies** (If Actor-based)
   - In `agentic_core/Cargo.toml`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     actix = "0.12"       # or latest
     actix-rt = "2.8"     # for the runtime
     ```
   - Or if purely custom, ensure
     `[dependencies] tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }`.

3. **Create `orchestrator.rs`**
   - `agentic_core/src/orchestrator.rs`

**Actor Example**:

```rust
// agentic_core/src/orchestrator.rs
use actix::prelude::*;
use uuid::Uuid;
use tracing::{info, error};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum SystemEvent {
    TaskSubmitted { task_id: Uuid, payload: String },
    TaskCompleted { task_id: Uuid, result: String },
}

pub struct Orchestrator;

impl Actor for Orchestrator {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
pub struct OrchestratorEvent(pub SystemEvent);

impl Handler<OrchestratorEvent> for Orchestrator {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: OrchestratorEvent, _ctx: &mut Context<Self>) -> Self::Result {
        match msg.0 {
            SystemEvent::TaskSubmitted { task_id, payload } => {
                info!("Orchestrator received TaskSubmitted({task_id}, {payload})");
                // Simulate immediate completion:
                let result = format!("Processed: {payload}");
                // Possibly notify other actors or store data
                info!("TaskCompleted for {task_id}");
            },
            SystemEvent::TaskCompleted { task_id, result } => {
                info!("Task Completed: {task_id} => {result}");
            },
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use actix::System;

    #[actix::test]
    async fn test_orchestrator_flow() {
        let addr = Orchestrator.start();
        let task_id = Uuid::new_v4();
        addr.do_send(OrchestratorEvent(SystemEvent::TaskSubmitted {
            task_id,
            payload: "Hello".into(),
        }));
        // Additional checks: see logs or store results in future phases
        // For now, just ensure no crash
    }
}
```

**Custom Tokio Loop Example**:

```rust
// agentic_core/src/orchestrator.rs
use uuid::Uuid;
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use tracing::{info};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum SystemEvent {
    TaskSubmitted { task_id: Uuid, payload: String },
    TaskCompleted { task_id: Uuid, result: String },
}

pub struct Orchestrator {
    event_tx: mpsc::Sender<SystemEvent>,
    event_rx: mpsc::Receiver<SystemEvent>,
}

impl Orchestrator {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(100);
        Self { event_tx: tx, event_rx: rx }
    }

    pub fn sender(&self) -> mpsc::Sender<SystemEvent> {
        self.event_tx.clone()
    }

    pub async fn run(mut self) {
        while let Some(event) = self.event_rx.recv().await {
            match event {
                SystemEvent::TaskSubmitted { task_id, payload } => {
                    info!("Received TaskSubmitted({task_id}, {payload})");
                    // Simulate immediate “work”
                    let completed = SystemEvent::TaskCompleted {
                        task_id,
                        result: format!("Processed: {payload}"),
                    };
                    // Send it back into the queue or handle it here
                    info!("TaskCompleted: {task_id}");
                },
                SystemEvent::TaskCompleted { task_id, result } => {
                    info!("Task Completed: {task_id} => {result}");
                },
            }
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use tokio::task;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_orchestrator_flow() {
        let orchestrator = Orchestrator::new();
        let sender = orchestrator.sender();
        task::spawn(orchestrator.run());

        let task_id = Uuid::new_v4();
        sender.send(SystemEvent::TaskSubmitted {
            task_id,
            payload: "Hello".into(),
        }).await.unwrap();

        // A more advanced test would check logs, or add code to read “TaskCompleted”
        // For now, just ensure no panic
    }
}
```

4. **Expose the Orchestrator**
   - In `agentic_core/src/lib.rs` add:
     ```rust
     pub mod element;
     pub mod pile;
     pub mod progression;
     pub mod store;
     pub mod orchestrator;  // new
     ```
   - Ensure it compiles and tests pass.

### 3.B. **Defining System Events**

If you want a separate file for events:

- `events.rs` (optional) with:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  pub enum SystemEvent {
      TaskSubmitted { task_id: Uuid, payload: String },
      TaskCompleted { task_id: Uuid, result: String },
  }
  ```

But typically, you can keep it inside `orchestrator.rs` for now.

### 3.C. **Integrating the CLI**

1. **Extend or Add Commands** in `agentic_cli/src/main.rs`:
   - Option A: Provide a `submit-task` subcommand that directly calls the
     orchestrator’s logic in-process.
   - Option B: Provide a `run-orchestrator` command to start an actor or event
     loop. Then a separate `submit-task` command triggers events (e.g., by
     sending via a channel, or Actix mailbox).

**Option A** – Single-process approach:

```rust
// agentic_cli/src/main.rs
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};
use agentic_core::orchestrator::{Orchestrator, SystemEvent};
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use uuid::Uuid;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name="lion-cli", version="0.0.1a")]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Commands,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    SubmitTask { data: String },
    // Possibly other commands from Phase 1
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    let orchestrator = Orchestrator::new();
    let sender = orchestrator.sender();
    // Spawn the orchestrator’s run loop
    tokio::spawn(orchestrator.run());

    match cli.command {
        Commands::SubmitTask { data } => {
            let task_id = Uuid::new_v4();
            sender.send(SystemEvent::TaskSubmitted {
                task_id,
                payload: data,
            }).await.unwrap();
            println!("Submitted task with ID: {task_id}");
        }
    }
}
```

- _Note_: This ephemeral approach means the orchestrator stops once the CLI
  command ends, unless you block the main thread or run something persistent.

**Option B** – Separate commands:

- `run-orchestrator`: blocks in an infinite loop waiting for events.
- `submit-task`: spawns a new process that sends an IPC request or writes to a
  known channel. This is more advanced and typically requires a message bus or
  some external channel.

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - `cargo run -p agentic_cli -- submit-task --data "Hello Phase2"`
   - Expect logs: “Received TaskSubmitted(...)”, “TaskCompleted(...)”.

### 3.D. **Validation & Tests**

1. **Compile & Lint**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy --all-targets
   ```
   Fix issues as needed.

2. **Orchestrator Unit Tests**
   - Already included in the snippet above (`test_orchestrator_flow`).
   - For Actix-based approach, you can confirm messages are handled.
   - For custom approach, confirm events are processed as expected.

3. **Integration Test** (CLI Approach)
   - Possibly create `tests/orchestrator_integration.rs`:
     ```rust
     #[test]
     fn test_submit_task_command() {
         // Use std::process::Command to run:
         // cargo run -p agentic_cli -- submit-task --data "test"
         // Check output. For now, we just confirm the process returns 0 exit code
     }
     ```
   - Or do a manual test by launching the CLI with multiple tasks.

4. **Phase 2 Tag**
   - Once stable, tag final commit as `v0.0.1a-phase2`:
     ```bash
     git tag v0.0.1a-phase2
     git push origin v0.0.1a-phase2
     ```
   - Write a short phase-level report in `docs/phase2_report.md` describing:
     - The new `SystemEvent` enum
     - Orchestrator logic (actor or custom)
     - Updated CLI
     - Tests performed

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

1. **Orchestrator Doesn’t “Stay Alive”**
   - If you do ephemeral approach with a single CLI call, the orchestrator might
     exit right after. That’s okay for Phase 2. In later phases, you might run a
     persistent orchestrator.

2. **Actix Actor Startup Issues**
   - If using Actix, ensure the `#[actix::test]` or normal
     `actix::System::run()` environment is properly set. If you get “no current
     reactor” errors, you need the Actix or tokio runtime.

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Confirm you have the right `[dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`, e.g., `actix`,
     `tokio`, `uuid`, etc.

4. **Interference with Phase 1’s Store**
   - The Phase 1 store is unaffected by the orchestrator. Phase 2 focuses on
     event flows, not storing tasks yet. Integration with `InMemoryStore` can
     happen in later phases if you want the orchestrator to persist tasks.

5. **Logging**
   - Use `tracing` or at least `println!` to see if the orchestrator processes
     events. If logs aren’t showing, check that your logging/tracing subscriber
     is set up (in `main` or tests).

---

## 5. Next Steps (Transition to Phase 3)

After Phase 2, you have:

- A **microkernel orchestrator** that processes basic system events.
- A new or updated CLI subcommand `submit-task` or `run-orchestrator`.
- Verified concurrency using tests.

**Phase 3** will introduce **Event Sourcing & Explainability**:

- Appending every `SystemEvent` to an immutable log or DB.
- Possibly replaying events to rebuild state.
- Further structured logging and correlation IDs.

With Phase 2 complete, your code can handle minimal tasks in an event-driven
manner—**a foundation** for deeper concurrency and multi-agent capabilities in
future phases.

---

# Phase 2 Summary

- **Goal**: Implement a minimal orchestrator for system events.
- **Outcome**: The CLI can submit tasks, and the orchestrator simulates a
  “TaskCompleted” event.
- **Validation**: Through unit tests (or actor tests) and CLI integration tests.
- **Milestone**: Tag as `v0.0.1a-phase2` upon successful demonstration and
  documentation in a phase report.

**Congratulations!** You now have a working microkernel orchestrator in Rust. On
to **Phase 3** for event sourcing and advanced logging.

# Review

Below is the **edited code review** and **updated PR description**, reflecting
your **rename to "lion"** instead of "liongate." All references now say “Lion
microkernel” or “lion project” where appropriate.

---

# **Phase 2 Code Review (Renamed to "lion")**

## 1. Overall Observations

- **Project Renamed**: The microkernel is now called **“lion,”** so references
  to “liongate” have been removed.
- **Phase 2 Goals**:
  - Introduce a **microkernel orchestrator** with event handling
    (`TaskSubmitted`, `TaskCompleted`, etc.).
  - Update the **CLI** to submit tasks in an asynchronous manner, receiving a
    completion event with a timeout.
  - Add **enhanced logging** via `tracing`.

**This PR** effectively does all that by bumping versions to
`0.0.1-alpha-phase2`, updating the CLI to ephemeral but concurrent orchestrator
usage, and expanding on structured logs. It’s a **good alignment** with
Phase 2’s objective.

---

## 2. File-by-File Feedback

### 2.1 `agentic_cli/Cargo.toml`

- Versions changed from `0.0.1-alpha-phase1` to `0.0.1-alpha-phase2`—**correct**
  for Phase 2.
- Some lines revert to older `clap`, `tokio`, or `uuid` versions in the diff
  snippet, so ensure final references to crates are consistent with your local
  preference.
- `tracing-subscriber` now uses `features = ["env-filter"]`; that’s excellent
  for controlling log levels via environment variables.

### 2.2 `agentic_cli/src/main.rs`

- Upgraded to `#[tokio::main] async fn main()`, perfect for concurrency.
- **CLI Changes**:
  - The old “CreateElement” subcommand is replaced by `SubmitTask` (plus
    optional correlation ID).
  - A 5-second `timeout` on receiving the “TaskCompleted” event.
  - If it times out, we show an error; otherwise, we print the result.
- **Tracing**:
  - New logs with file/line number, thread IDs, etc.
  - Good for diagnosing concurrency tasks.
- **Integration**:
  - We see ephemeral store usage from Phase 1 plus ephemeral orchestrator—**a
    logical step** for Phase 2.
  - Future phases might unify them or keep ephemeral approach until advanced
    usage.

### 2.3 `agentic_core/Cargo.toml`

- Bumps to `0.0.1-alpha-phase2`.
- Replaces older versions of `uuid`, `tokio`, etc. with new ones.
- Adds `async-trait`—**which is not visible in the PR snippet** but presumably
  you’ll use it for upcoming agent traits or plugin logic in future phases.

### 2.4 `agentic_core/src/lib.rs`

- Re-exports `Orchestrator` and `SystemEvent`, which is **great** for the CLI to
  access them directly.
- The rest remains as from Phase 1 (element, pile, progression, store).

### 2.5 `agentic_core/src/orchestrator.rs`

- **Core** of Phase 2. Defines:
  - `SystemEvent` with metadata for correlation ID.
  - An `Orchestrator` using `mpsc` for event input and `broadcast` for
    completion notifications.
  - `run()` method that processes each event, quickly simulating “processed”
    tasks.
  - On success, it sends a `TaskCompleted` event via broadcast.
- **Tests**:
  - `test_orchestrator_processes_task` ensures we get a `TaskCompleted`.
  - `test_correlation_id_propagation` checks that the correlation ID is
    preserved.
- This design is **clean** and lines up with Phase 2’s ephemeral concurrency
  demonstration.

---

## 3. Strengths & Recommendations

**Strengths**:

1. **Clear concurrency model**: The orchestrator is ephemeral, but
   well-structured.
2. **Robust event definitions** with `metadata` for correlation or extended
   context.
3. **Traces**: Additional logs with `file` and `line_number`—**nice** for
   debugging.
4. **Timeout** in the CLI is user-friendly, preventing indefinite hangs.

**Potential Enhancements**:

- If you want multiple tasks in one run, consider either not exiting the CLI or
  allowing a separate `run-orchestrator` command.
- For advanced correlation or partial outputs, next phases will expand on it.

Overall, your code is well-implemented for Phase 2. **No major issues** found.
Great job.

# **Updated PR Description** (Renamed Project to “lion”)

```markdown
## Description

This PR implements **Phase 2** of the **lion microkernel** project (previously
known as “liongate”):

- Bumps package versions from `0.0.1-alpha-phase1` to `0.0.1-alpha-phase2`.
- Introduces a **microkernel orchestrator** with a new `SystemEvent` enum
  (`TaskSubmitted`, `TaskCompleted`, `TaskError`) and minimal concurrency logic.
- Updates the **CLI** to submit tasks (`submit-task`) via an ephemeral
  orchestrator:
  - Spawns the orchestrator's event loop.
  - Sends a `TaskSubmitted` event with optional correlation ID.
  - Waits for `TaskCompleted` or times out after 5 seconds.
- Enhances **logging** (via `tracing`) with line numbers, file, and thread info.

## Type of Change

- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)

## How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] **Unit Tests**: In `agentic_core::orchestrator` verifying event flow
      (`test_orchestrator_processes_task`, `test_correlation_id_propagation`).
- [x] **Integration Tests**: CLI usage to ensure ephemeral orchestrator spawns,
      processes tasks, returns completions.
- [x] **Manual Testing**: Ran
      `cargo run -p agentic_cli -- submit-task --data "test payload"` locally.
      Observed logs, verified task completed event arrived.

## Test Configuration

- **Rust version**: 1.70+
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
