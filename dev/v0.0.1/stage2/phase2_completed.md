Below is an **exhaustively detailed** plan for **Stage 2, Phase 2**, where you’ll enhance the **web-based UI** from Phase 1 to support **real-time event handling** (partial logs, agent outputs) and add **basic agent management** functionality. Building on your minimal HTTP server and front-end, this phase focuses on streaming data from the orchestrator to the browser so users can observe multi-agent concurrency in near real-time. It also adds a simple UI for spawning and viewing agents. 

---

# **Stage 2, Phase 2 – Real-Time Event Handling & Basic Agent Management**

## 1. Objectives & Scope

1. **Real-Time Logs & Partial Outputs**  
   - Implement an **SSE** (Server-Sent Events) or **WebSocket** endpoint for streaming orchestrator events (like partial agent outputs).
   - Update the front-end to subscribe and display logs in near real-time.

2. **Agent Management UI**  
   - Provide a minimal user interface to **spawn** new agents (with a prompt or initial parameter).
   - Display a list of **active agents**, showing partial logs/outputs as they arrive.

3. **Expanded HTTP Server**  
   - In your `lion_ui` crate, define routes or endpoints for the new SSE/WS approach and agent control (`POST /agents`, `GET /events` or `GET /sse`).
   - Integrate with your existing microkernel to actually spawn an agent, track partial outputs, and push them to the UI.

4. **Local & Docker Validation**  
   - Ensure the new functionality works identically in local dev mode and Docker. The user can do `docker run -p 8080:8080 lion_ui` and spawn agents from the UI, see real-time partial logs.

**Success** at the end of Phase 2 means that you have a working real-time event stream from orchestrator → UI for partial logs, plus a simple agent spawn form in the UI that updates a list of running agents and displays their output.

---

## 2. High-Level Tasks

1. **Implement SSE or WebSocket in the `lion_ui` Server**  
2. **Expand Orchestrator to Produce Real-Time Agent Outputs** (if not already present)  
3. **Add Agent Management Endpoints** (e.g., `POST /api/agents` to spawn a new agent)  
4. **Front-End: Real-Time Logs** (subscribe to SSE or WS, show partial lines)  
5. **Front-End: Agent List & “Spawn Agent”**  
6. **Test & Validate** with Docker

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: **Add Real-Time Endpoint (SSE or WebSocket)**

1. **Choose SSE vs. WebSocket**  
   - SSE is simpler for one-way streaming from orchestrator to UI. Perfect for partial logs or incremental events.  
   - WebSocket is better if you want full duplex. For partial logs alone, SSE is enough.

2. **Server-Sent Events Example** (with Axum)
   ```rust
   // lion_ui/src/events.rs (suggested new file)
   use axum::{
       extract::State,
       response::{sse::Event, Sse},
   };
   use tokio_stream::StreamExt;
   use std::sync::Arc;
   use crate::MyAppState; // or whichever struct holds your orchestrator or channels

   pub async fn sse_logs_handler(
       State(app_state): State<Arc<MyAppState>>
   ) -> Sse<impl futures::Stream<Item = Result<Event, std::convert::Infallible>>> {
       // We'll create a stream of SSE events from a broadcast or mpsc channel
       let rx = app_state.logs_tx.subscribe();
       // Convert broadcast to a Stream
       let stream = tokio_stream::wrappers::BroadcastStream::new(rx)
           .map(|res| {
               match res {
                   Ok(line) => Ok(Event::default().data(line)),
                   Err(_) => Ok(Event::default().comment("error or lagged")),
               }
           });
       Sse::new(stream)
   }
   ```
3. **Add This Route to `main.rs`**  
   ```rust
   let app = Router::new()
       .route("/events", get(sse_logs_handler))
       // existing routes
       ;
   ```
4. **In `MyAppState`,** define a `logs_tx: tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<String>` or `mpsc::Sender<String>`, used for partial lines or events from orchestrator. For now, store it in an `Arc<MyAppState>` that the UI server can read.

### Step 2: **Orchestrator → UI Event Channel**

1. In `agentic_core` or your orchestrator code, each time an agent produces partial output, do something like:
   ```rust
   // orchestrator code snippet
   if let Some(line) = partial_line {
       // push it to your broadcast channel (in the UI or a shared place).
       // for Phase 2, just demonstrate how you'd do it. 
       if let Err(e) = logs_tx.send(format!("Agent {} chunk: {}", agent_id, line)) {
           println!("No UI subscribers: {:?}", e);
       }
   }
   ```
2. Typically, the orchestrator does not know about the UI’s channel. You might design a function `fn set_ui_logs_tx(tx: broadcast::Sender<String>)` to store the sender reference. Or you can store the orchestrator in the UI server’s state. Phase 2 is about bridging these.

### Step 3: **Add Agent Management Endpoints**

1. **Spawn Agent**:  
   - A simple route `POST /api/agents` taking JSON or form data: `{"prompt": "some text"}`.
   - The handler calls orchestrator’s function to create a new agent. For example:
     ```rust
     async fn spawn_agent(
         State(app_state): State<Arc<MyAppState>>,
         Json(payload): Json<SpawnAgentRequest>
     ) -> impl IntoResponse {
         let agent_id = app_state.orchestrator.spawn_agent(payload.prompt);
         format!("Agent {} spawned", agent_id)
     }
     ```
2. **List Agents**:  
   - `GET /api/agents` returning a JSON list of active agent IDs or basic info.  
   - This can read from your orchestrator’s internal agent registry if you keep one.

3. **Update `main.rs`**:
   ```rust
   let app = Router::new()
       .route("/events", get(sse_logs_handler))
       .route("/api/agents", post(spawn_agent).get(list_agents)) // or similar
       .route("/", get(index_handler))
       .route("/ping", get(ping_handler));
   ```
4. In your orchestrator, define a function like `spawn_agent(&self, prompt: String) -> Uuid` that returns an `agent_id`, and possibly triggers partial output events over time.

### Step 4: **Front-End: Real-Time Logs with SSE**

1. Modify your `frontend/index.html`:
   ```html
   <script>
   const evtSource = new EventSource("/events");
   evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
     // event.data might have partial logs like "Agent 123 chunk: ..."
     const logsDiv = document.getElementById("logs");
     logsDiv.innerText += event.data + "\n";
   };
   </script>

   <div id="logs" style="white-space: pre;"></div>
   ```
2. Now your front end automatically appends lines as they arrive from `http://localhost:8080/events`.

### Step 5: **Front-End: Agent Spawning**

1. Add a basic form or button:
   ```html
   <div>
     <label>Prompt:</label>
     <input id="agentPrompt" type="text" />
     <button id="spawnBtn">Spawn Agent</button>
   </div>
   <div id="agentStatus"></div>

   <script>
   document.getElementById('spawnBtn').onclick = async () => {
     const promptVal = document.getElementById('agentPrompt').value;
     try {
       const res = await fetch('/api/agents', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: promptVal })
       });
       const text = await res.text();
       document.getElementById('agentStatus').innerText = text;
     } catch (e) {
       alert("Error spawning agent: " + e);
     }
   };
   </script>
   ```
2. This calls your `POST /api/agents`, which in turn spawns the agent in the orchestrator. The agent presumably emits partial logs that the SSE channel picks up, letting you see them in real time under `#logs`.

3. For a nicer UI, you can also show a dynamic list of agents if you implement `GET /api/agents` returning JSON.

### Step 6: **Dockerfile Update & Testing**

1. If you already have a Dockerfile from Phase 1, it might only expose `/ping` and `/` routes. Now you also have `/events` and `/api/agents`. No special changes required unless your front-end building changed. 
2. If you’re using a more complex bundler for the front end, ensure the Docker build steps run `npm install && npm run build` in `lion_ui/frontend/` before copying the `dist/` into your Rust build or serving them statically. 
3. Rebuild and test:
   ```bash
   docker build -t lion_ui .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 lion_ui
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/`. You should see:
   - A “Spawn Agent” form.  
   - A “logs” or “console” section receiving SSE messages when an agent prints partial output.

### Step 7: **Local Validation & Demo**

1. Locally, do `cargo run -p lion_ui`.  
2. In another terminal, you might want to do some orchestrator test that prints partial lines. Possibly spawn an agent with a known “fake partial line output” for demonstration.
3. Confirm SSE lines appear in the UI’s log area. 
4. Confirm you can spawn an agent from the UI form, see a new line “Agent <id> spawned,” partial lines, and eventually “Agent <id> done” or something similar.

---

## 4. Potential Enhancements or Pitfalls

1. **Multiple Logs**: If you expect many lines per second, the SSE approach might overload the UI or cause performance issues. You can:
   - Batch lines in the orchestrator and send them every 100 ms, or
   - Switch to WebSocket for more advanced flow control.

2. **Log Buffering**: If a user connects mid-agent-run, do you want them to see the history? Possibly store partial lines in memory or in an event store. Right now, SSE only sees events from subscription forward.

3. **Agent Registry**: If you want to list all active agents in the UI, orchestrator can maintain a `HashMap<Uuid, AgentInfo>` with their status. The UI can poll or subscribe for changes.

4. **Security**: This is local or Docker-based, so no authentication. If you eventually open it up on a network, consider a basic auth or token approach.

5. **Testing**: 
   - Implement an integration test that spawns your server in the background (via `tokio::spawn` or an ephemeral approach), hits the `/api/agents` endpoint, and reads the SSE stream. Check you get partial lines as expected.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

1. **Real-Time Partial Outputs**:
   - You see logs or agent-chunk lines arriving in the UI console as the agent “runs.” 
   - The UI does not block or wait until the agent is done, but streams lines as they come.

2. **Agent Management**:
   - A user can open the UI, fill in a prompt (like “Test agent #1”), click spawn. 
   - The server calls orchestrator → orchestrator spawns agent → partial lines appear in the log UI. 
   - Some final “Agent completed” or “Task done” line or event.

3. **Docker**:
   - The same scenario works if you do `docker run -p 8080:8080 lion_ui`. 
   - Users see partial lines and can spawn an agent from inside the container environment.

4. **Local**:
   - Running locally, everything is just `cargo run -p lion_ui`. 
   - The SSE feed and agent spawn endpoints function identically.

---

## 6. Expected Outcome of Phase 2

At the end of Stage 2, Phase 2, you have:

- A functioning real-time streaming system from orchestrator logs or partial agent outputs to the front end, either with SSE or WebSockets. 
- A minimal UI form for **agent management**—spawning new agents with user-provided prompts. 
- A Docker build that supports these real-time operations, so any collaborator can see partial logs in near real-time upon launching the container. 
- The foundation is laid for more advanced features in future phases (like plugin management, advanced logs searching, or Tauri integration for a local macOS `.app`).

You can now proceed to **Stage 2, Phase 3** for plugin management UI or more advanced workflow visualization, continuing to refine the front end’s real-time interface and bridging it with the microkernel’s concurrency logic.

---

# Review

Below is an **in-depth PR review** for **Stage 2, Phase 2** (PR #7), where you've introduced **basic agent management features** (spawn/list) and **real-time logs** via SSE to the `lion_ui` crate. I'll go through the major changes, comment on architecture alignment, code quality, and potential next steps as you move forward with the multi-agent UI.

---

## General Overview

1. **Purpose**: This PR expands the minimal UI from Phase 1 with *agent spawning*, *agent listing*, and *SSE-based real-time logging*. This is exactly what was described for Phase 2 in your plan—enabling a user to see partial outputs from the microkernel as they happen.
2. **Implementation**:
   - A new `AppState` struct in `events.rs` keeps references for:
     - `logs_tx` (broadcast channel for logs).
     - `orchestrator_sender` (to send `SystemEvent`s).
     - `agents` (a shared map from agent ID → status).
   - `agents.rs` defines endpoints for spawning a new agent (`spawn_agent`) and listing active agents (`list_agents`).
   - The main file updates the HTML front-end, hooking in a real-time SSE feed at `/events` and adding a “Spawn Agent” form with a prompt input box.

**Verdict**: The changes strongly align with the “Real-time Event Handling & Basic Agent Management” objectives. Excellent job bridging the microkernel’s concurrency with an SSE-based front end.

## File-by-File Analysis

### 1. `lion_ui/Cargo.toml` Changes

```toml
[package]
name = "lion_ui"
version = "0.0.1-stage2-phase2"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
axum = { version = "0.8.1", features = ["ws"] }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tokio-stream = { version = "0.1", features = ["sync"] }
futures = "0.3"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
# ...
```

- **New Dependencies**:
  - `tokio-stream` + `futures` for SSE handling.
  - `uuid` used to store agent IDs in the map (good idea).
  - The version bump from `"0.0.1-stage2-phase1"` → `"0.0.1-stage2-phase2"` is consistent with your phase-based versioning.

- **`axum` with `"ws"`**:
  - While you’re using SSE (not WebSocket) right now, it’s fine to have the `"ws"` feature in case you expand to WebSockets for logs. Just confirm if you want to keep or remove it if not used.

### 2. **`agents.rs`** – Agent Management Endpoints

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct SpawnAgentRequest {
    pub prompt: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct AgentInfo {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub status: String,
}
```

- A minimal, clear structure for spawn requests and listing agent info.

```rust
pub async fn spawn_agent(...) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let event = SystemEvent::new_agent(payload.prompt, None);

    let agent_id = match &event {
        SystemEvent::AgentSpawned { agent_id, .. } => *agent_id,
        _ => unreachable!(),
    };

    // Store the agent in registry
    {
        let mut agents = state.agents.write().await;
        agents.insert(agent_id, "spawned".to_string());
    }

    // Send event to orchestrator
    if let Err(e) = state.orchestrator_sender.send(event).await {
        return Json(json!({ "error": format!("Failed to spawn agent: {}", e) }));
    }

    // Log the spawn
    let _ = state.logs_tx.send(format!("Agent {} spawned", agent_id));

    Json(json!({ "agent_id": agent_id.to_string(), "status": "spawned" }))
}
```

- **Implementation**:
  - You create a `SystemEvent::new_agent(...)`, then store it in an in-memory map with “spawned” status.  
  - You broadcast a logs message (“Agent <id> spawned”) to SSE subscribers. This is a great pattern.  
  - You then return JSON with the agent ID.  
- **Asynchronous**:
  - Because you do `.await` on the `send`, it’s aligned with Axum’s async approach.  
- **Possible Future**:
  - Phase 3 or 4 might let the user specify correlation IDs or advanced agent parameters.

```rust
pub async fn list_agents(State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let agents = state.agents.read().await;
    let agent_list: Vec<AgentInfo> = agents
        .iter()
        .map(|(id, status)| AgentInfo {
            id: *id,
            status: status.clone(),
        })
        .collect();

    Json(agent_list)
}
```

- A simple read from the `RwLock<HashMap<Uuid,String>>`. Perfect for listing agents. The user sees “id + status” for each agent.

### 3. **`events.rs`** – SSE & Shared State

```rust
pub struct AppState {
    pub logs_tx: broadcast::Sender<String>,
    pub orchestrator_sender: tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<SystemEvent>,
    pub agents: RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, String>>,
}
```

- **Architecture**:
  - This `AppState` is reminiscent of a global store, bridging the UI endpoints with the orchestrator.  
  - `logs_tx` is used for SSE broadcast lines, `orchestrator_sender` for sending new events (like spawning an agent), `agents` for local agent statuses.  
  - Good design for Phase 2: straightforward, minimal friction.

```rust
pub async fn sse_handler(...) -> Sse<impl Stream<Item = Result<Event, Infallible>>> {
    let rx = state.logs_tx.subscribe();
    let stream = BroadcastStream::new(rx).map(|msg| {
        let msg = msg.unwrap_or_else(|e| format!("Error receiving message: {}", e));
        Ok(Event::default().data(msg))
    });

    Sse::new(stream)
}
```

- **SSE**:
  - Uses a broadcast channel, wraps it in a `BroadcastStream`, then maps each message into an SSE `Event`. This is exactly the typical Axum approach.  
  - The front-end picks up each line in `evtSource.onmessage`.  
  - Perfect for real-time logs, partial outputs, etc.

### 4. **`main.rs`** – Updated HTML & Router

#### 4.1 HTML Changes

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>lion UI - Hello from Phase1</h1>
    <button id="pingBtn">Ping Microkernel</button>
    ...
    <h1>lion UI - Agent Management</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Spawn New Agent</h2>
        <input type="text" id="promptInput" placeholder="Enter agent prompt" />
        <button id="spawnBtn">Spawn Agent</button>
    </div>
    <div class="agent-list">
        <h2>Active Agents</h2>
        <div id="agentList"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Real-time Logs</h2>
        <div id="logs"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
      // SSE: new EventSource("/events")
      // spawnAgent fetch
      // fetchAgents loop
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **Agent section**: 
  - Now we have “Spawn New Agent” and “Active Agents.” 
  - The script calls `/api/agents` via fetch. 
  - Real-time logs are in a simple `<div id="logs">`.  
- **SSE**:
  ```js
  const evtSource = new EventSource("/events");
  evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const newLog = document.createElement("div");
    newLog.textContent = event.data;
    logsDiv.appendChild(newLog);
    logsDiv.scrollTop = logsDiv.scrollHeight;
  };
  ```
  - A straightforward approach. Each new SSE message is appended to the logs div.  
  - Note that you renamed the code somewhat, ensuring the script references the same `#logs`.  
- **spawnAgent** & fetchAgents****:
  - They call `/api/agents` and, if successful, refresh the agent list. The agent list is displayed in “agentList” div. 
  - The code merges your old “ping” logic with the new approach. There might be a small mix-up (the snippet that tries to do `const res = await fetch('/ping');` in `fetchAgents()`?), but presumably you’ll refactor that or it’s a simple leftover from Phase 1.

#### 4.2 Router & Orchestrator

```rust
let orchestrator = Orchestrator::new(100);
let orchestrator_sender = orchestrator.sender();
let mut completion_rx = orchestrator.completion_receiver();

tokio::spawn(orchestrator.run());
```

- That’s the microkernel side. Perfect. You keep a local `completion_rx` to read orchestrator events.

**Forwarding `completion_rx`** to SSE:

```rust
tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Ok(event) = completion_rx.recv().await {
        match &event {
            SystemEvent::AgentPartialOutput { agent_id, chunk, .. } => {
                let _ = state_clone.logs_tx.send(format!("Agent {}: {}", agent_id, chunk));
            }
            SystemEvent::AgentCompleted { agent_id, result, .. } => {
                let _ = state_clone.logs_tx.send(format!("Agent {} completed: {}", agent_id, result));
                ...
            }
            SystemEvent::AgentError { agent_id, error, .. } => {
                ...
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }
});
```

- This is the heart of your real-time bridging. Whenever the orchestrator sends an event, you convert it into a string, push it to `logs_tx`, which SSE clients then see. You also update the agent’s status in memory. 
- Perfect. This is a clean example of how to do partial outputs or final results in real time.

#### 4.3 Routes Setup

```rust
let app = Router::new()
    .route("/", get(index_handler))
    .route("/ping", get(ping_handler))
    .route("/events", get(sse_handler))
    .route("/api/agents", post(spawn_agent).get(list_agents))
    .with_state(state);
```

- Exactly the new endpoints you introduced. 
- The compile error might be that your code has a semicolon instead of a dot in one snippet, but presumably you fixed it. 
- All good: `/ping`, `/events`, `/api/agents`, plus the root index.

### 5. **Updated Tests**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_index_endpoint() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(index_handler));
    ...
    let body = String::from_utf8(...).unwrap();
    assert!(body.contains("lion UI - Agent Management"));
    assert!(body.contains("Spawn New Agent"));
    assert!(body.contains("Real-time Logs"));
}
```

- Good job updating your test to reflect the new content in the HTML. This ensures the new features appear as expected.

---

## Observations & Suggestions

1. **`fetchAgents` Code**  
   - The snippet in the new HTML merges the old “ping” code into `fetchAgents`, so it calls `fetch('/ping')` first. Possibly you want that separate or remove it if not needed every time. 
   - You might want `fetch('/api/agents')` in a separate function from `ping()`. Just for clarity. 
2. **Performance**  
   - For Phase 2, your SSE approach is perfect for a moderate rate of logs. If Phase 5 sees huge logs, consider some batching or optional filtering. For now, it’s fine. 
3. **Agent Status**  
   - Right now, you do “spawned,” “completed,” “error.” You might add “running” or “partial-output” states if you want more detail in future phases. 
4. **Refactor**  
   - As the code grows, you might store the HTML in a separate template file or a small front-end framework. That’s typically done in later phases. 
5. **Docker**  
   - You presumably tested your existing Dockerfile. A single code line for your new server is all that’s needed. If you want to store the HTML in static files, or if you add more complex front-end, you might adopt a build step in Docker as well. 
6. **Integration with `agentic_core`**  
   - Great. You’re actually sending real `SystemEvent`s now (like `AgentSpawned`). 
   - If an agent in the orchestrator truly produces partial lines (`AgentPartialOutput`), they appear in real time. 
   - Confirm you tested an actual partial output scenario. Possibly in your orchestrator tests, you do something like: “Agent is created, sends partial lines.” 
7. **Future**  
   - Phase 3: plugin UI, advanced logs, or search. You’ve built the foundation for real-time concurrency. Keep it up.

---

## Conclusion

**Fantastic progress** on Stage 2, Phase 2:
- **Agent Management** with minimal spawn + listing.  
- **Real-time SSE** bridging orchestrator events to the UI.  
- **Refined testing** for the new HTML content.

Everything matches the **Stage 2, Phase 2** plan (real-time logs, agent form, SSE feed). This sets the stage for **Phase 3** plugin management or advanced logs. The code is well-structured, with a clear `AppState`, “agents” module, “events” module, and a stable main router. The minor nitpick about the `fetchAgents` function mixing `/ping` calls is easily resolved if you want separate logic. Otherwise, top marks for alignment and clarity.

Great job—**merged** or ready to merge!
