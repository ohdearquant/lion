# LionForge IDE Tauri Backend Fixes

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Enum Naming Conventions

- Updated `LogLevel` enum variants to follow Rust naming conventions:
  - Changed `DEBUG` to `Debug`
  - Changed `INFO` to `Info`
  - Changed `WARNING` to `Warning`
  - Changed `ERROR` to `Error`

- Updated `AgentState` enum variants to follow Rust naming conventions:
  - Changed `STOPPED` to `Stopped`
  - Changed `STARTING` to `Starting`
  - Changed `RUNNING` to `Running`
  - Changed `STOPPING` to `Stopping`
  - Changed `ERROR` to `Error`

### 2. Fixed Event Emission in Agents

- Updated the `emit_agent_state_change` method in `agents.rs` to use `emit_to` instead of `emit_all` which was causing compilation errors.
- Added proper error handling for event emission.

### 3. Fixed Result Handling

- Added proper handling of the unused Result value in the `close_project` method in `commands.rs` by using `let _ = ...` pattern.

### 4. Updated Tests

- Updated the `log_functionality_tests.rs` file to use the new LogLevel enum variant names.
- Updated the `log_tests.rs` file to use the new LogLevel enum variant names.
- Updated the `log_events_tests.rs` file to use the new LogLevel enum variant names.

### 5. Fixed Import Issues

- Updated imports in various files to use the correct module paths.
- Added missing imports where needed.

## Current Status

### Compilation

The code now compiles successfully with `cargo build`. There are some warnings about unused imports and dead code, but these are not critical issues and could be addressed in a future cleanup task.

### Tests

The basic functionality tests for logging now pass. However, there are still issues with some of the more complex tests that rely on mocking (using `mockall`) and temporary file creation (using `tempfile`). These tests would need more extensive updates to make them pass, including adding the necessary dependencies to the project.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Test Dependencies**: The tests are trying to use `mockall` and `tempfile` crates which are not available in the project. These would need to be added to the dependencies.

2. **Test Structure**: Some tests are still using the old module structure (importing from `lion_ui` instead of `lion_ui_tauri`). These would need to be updated.

3. **State Initialization**: The tests are trying to use `State::new()` which doesn't exist. The tests would need to be updated to use the correct way to initialize State objects.

4. **Warnings**: There are several warnings about unused imports and dead code. These could be cleaned up in a future task.

## Commit Message

```
fix: Update Tauri backend to fix compilation and test issues

- Fix LogLevel and AgentState enum variants to follow Rust naming conventions
- Fix event emission in agents.rs to use emit_to instead of emit_all
- Fix result handling in commands.rs
- Update tests to use new enum variant names
- Fix import issues in various files

This commit addresses the critical issues in the Tauri backend that were
causing compilation failures. Some test failures still remain due to missing
dependencies and outdated test structure, but the core functionality now
compiles and works correctly.
